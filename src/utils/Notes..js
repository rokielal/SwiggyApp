/*
There are two types of export and import
1 - Default export / import
2 - Names export / import 

eg: 
Default:-
export default Component;
import Component from "path"

Named:-
export const Component;
import {Component} from path;

Note: Whenever we need to export two or more things like variable or images we have to do named export/import because only one default export is possible from one file.

Reconcilation is also known as React Fiber

Whenever state variable updates, react triggeres reconcilation (re-render the component)
